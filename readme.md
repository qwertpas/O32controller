Small robots often use servos or small brushed DC motors, but they are not as power dense as the brushless DC (BLDC) motors commonly found in drones. Called the Ã˜32 because the M2 mounting holes are on a 32mm diameter circle, this project controls 7-15V motors with accurate position feedback and field-oriented control (FOC), while fitting almost completely behind a 2304 or larger drone motor.


Specs:
- 27mm x 27mm x 0.8mm, 4-layer, 1oz copper PCB
- M2 mounting holes on a 32mm diameter circle
- 7-15V input, bus voltage sensing
- MCU internal temperature sensor and external NTC reading
- built-in high speed 12-bit magnetic angle sensor and external SPI encoder port (3.3V)
- 3 shunt current sensing and overcurrent protection 
- 2x 2-pin JST-SH connectors for RS-485 communication, allowing daisy chaining
- 1x 4-pin JST-SH connector for SWD programming/debug and UART_TX output

Critical components:
- STSPIN32F0A BLDC gate driver and Cortex-M0 MCU
- MA702 magnetic angle sensor
- CSD88584Q5DC half-bridge (50A continuous)

Changelog from v2 to v3:
- Fixed TVS diode direction on VBUS (!!)
- Changed to 37x 22uF ceramic capacitors instead of 2x 100uF electrolytic capacitors for a thinner PCBA
- Removed I2C (formerly on PB6 and PB7)
- Moved UART_TX and UART_RX to PB6 and PB7 (formerly on PA2 and PA15)
- Changed PA2 to ADC1 CH2 to read a 10k NTC, soldered to pads
- Changed PA15 to GPIO for external SPI CS (MAG2_CS)
- Added 13.7k pulldown on SPI_MISO to keep it determined when no devices selected
- Changed to 100nF filter capacitor on BUS_SENSE instead of 1nF to charge ADC capacitor better and for smoother data
- Changed BUS_SENSE gain to 5x instead of 5.12x to reuse 13.7k resistor
- Removed test point on BUS_SENSE
- Added test point on LED_STATUS (for debugging using GPIO)
- Removed NRST pushbutton to create space
- Added 6 pads with 0.5mm pitch to solder FFC cable for an external SPI encoder
- Changed vias to 0.25mm hole size and 0.55mm plated diameter instead of 0.2/0.5 for easier manufacturability
- Changed minimum track clearance from 0.2mm to 0.16mm to make space for larger vias
- Changed to equal number of vias (27) on the top side of all three shunt resistors
- Changed most silkscreen text to 0.8mm width/height
- Put all footprints and 3D models in project library O32controller
